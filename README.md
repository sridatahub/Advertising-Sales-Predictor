# Advertising-Sales-Predictor
A Streamlit-based machine learning app that predicts product sales using TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising costs.

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting product sales based on advertising budgets allocated across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels. It uses a machine learning approach to model the relationship between marketing investments and sales performance, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

Model Performance

A Linear Regression model was trained to predict sales with high accuracy. The model achieved an R² score of 0.90, indicating that it explains approximately 90% of the variance in sales data. This strong performance highlights the effectiveness of advertisement spending as a predictor of sales outcomes.

For example, when the actual sales value was 22.1, the model predicted 21.37, demonstrating minimal prediction error and strong reliability.

Algorithm Used

Linear Regression is used to model the linear relationship between advertising budgets and sales. Its simplicity, interpretability, and strong predictive performance make it well-suited for this problem.

Input Features

TV Advertising Cost

Radio Advertising Cost

Newspaper Advertising Cost

Predicted Sales Value

Application Workflow

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, beginning with data preprocessing and model training, followed by model evaluation and deployment.

Web Application

The trained model is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit. The application allows users to enter advertising spending values and instantly receive predicted sales outputs through a simple and intuitive interface.

Business Impact

This project highlights how data-driven insights can help businesses optimize marketing budgets and improve sales performance. By understanding the impact of different advertising channels, organizations can allocate resources more effectively to maximize returns.
